# Module-11-Challenge: 
**Part 1: Mars News Scraping Project**
This project focuses on extracting news articles from the Mars News website using Python-based web scraping techniques. The primary libraries used include Splinter for automated browsing and BeautifulSoup for parsing and scraping the HTML content. The objective was to collect the titles and preview text of articles listed on the website. The scraping process involved identifying and extracting specific HTML elements corresponding to the article titles and previews by inspecting the webpage structure using Chrome DevTools. Each article's title and preview text were stored as key-value pairs in dictionaries, and these dictionaries were appended to a list to organize the data effectively. The final list of dictionaries provides a structured format for further analysis or storage, showcasing how automated web scraping can be used to extract and compile information from a website efficiently.

**Part 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis**
This project involves the extraction, analysis, and visualization of weather data collected by the Curiosity rover on Mars. The dataset was scraped from an HTML table on the Mars Temperature Data website using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Splinter for web scraping. The data includes information on Martian days (sols), terrestrial dates, solar longitude (ls), Martian months, minimum daily temperatures, and atmospheric pressure at the rover's location. The extracted data was processed into a structured format using Pandas, with appropriate type conversions for numerical and datetime columns to facilitate analysis.
The analysis explores various aspects of Martian weather. It identifies the number of months on Mars and calculates the total sols of data available. Seasonal trends were analyzed by grouping data by Martian months to determine the coldest and warmest months based on average minimum temperatures, as well as the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure. These insights were visualized using bar charts to illustrate seasonal variations in temperature and pressure.
Furthermore, the periodicity of Martian weather was investigated by plotting minimum temperatures over terrestrial days, which visually estimates the duration of a Martian year. All results and processed datasets were exported to CSV files for further use. These include the raw data, average minimum temperatures by month, and average atmospheric pressures by month. This project showcases the use of Python for web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover seasonal weather patterns on Mars.
